# OpenCV_multithread_recordvideo-screenshot
This program in C++ can do screenshots (average of 1s images) and record a video at the same time on the same device. But you can use up to 10 devices at the same time too. 

For now you can use Dazzle DVC 100 and QSonic with SVideo / Composite inputs and a Webcam Logitech C920.
